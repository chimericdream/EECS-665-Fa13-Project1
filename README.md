# EECS 665 - Project 1
## Fall 2013

This is the repository for Bill Parrott's submission for the [Compiler Construction](http://www.ittc.ku.edu/~kulkarni/teaching/EECS665/) class at the [University of Kansas](http://www.ku.edu/).

### Execution
To run the program, simply type `php main.php` from the directory containing the code. The program will prompt for a filename to use for the input and output files. If you do not enter anything, the default filenames will be used.

The program will display the output to the screen as well as writing it to the output file.
